                    <p>Here are some pointers to help you be safe when using the internet:
â€¢ Look for "ðŸ”’" and "https://" at the start of a website: This indicates that your connection is safe.
â€¢ Verify whether the URL points to the SaathChalo website: Even though a link in a message appears legitimate, it's a scam if the URL doesn't point to the official website, https://www.saathChalo.com Check the complete URL of the page before entering your payment or login details.
â€¢ Just use your gadget: Don't set up accounts or enter passwords on non-personal devices, such as a friend's phone or an internet cafÃ©.
â€¢ Update your gadgets and software: These updates frequently include new security safeguards and address security vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <h5>Off-site payments and messages</h5>
                    <p>Some safety advice to remember when messaging other members: 
â€¢ Only swap on SaatChalo: Avoid exchanging before making a reservation on other platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger. 
â€¢ Protect your personal information: Never give out your phone number, email address, or payment information to someone before scheduling a ride. 
â€¢ Avoid clicking on links in messages: Never open a link or click on anything in dubious or unwanted messages received through third-party messaging apps or the SaatChalo network.</p>
