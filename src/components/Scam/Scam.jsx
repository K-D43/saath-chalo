                  <p>Scams succeed because they look like the real thing. Scammers are getting smarter:
                they will try to make you visit another website, very similar to ours, that will convince you to give them your money or payment details.</p>
                  <p>Make sure you‚Äôre always paying on BlaBlaCar‚Äôs app or website.</p>

                  <h5>By creating fake user profiles</h5>
                  <p>Fake profiles are usually created just a few days or hours ago and don‚Äôt have any ratings from other members. They also often charge less than ‚Äåother similar rides. Before or after booking the ride, they could try to contact you outside of our platform (through your phone or WhatsApp).</p>
                  <p>If you think you interacted with a fake profile, you can report it.</p>

                    <h5>Password quality</h5>
                    <p>Your password should be at least 8 characters with a mix of at least 1 letter, 1 number, and 1 special character (e.g. #, @, &). Having complex and unique passwords on all your accounts, not just your BlaBlaCar account, will greatly reduce the chances of having security issues.</p>

                    <p>A few tips to help keep you safe online:
‚Ä¢ Check for ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù and ‚Äúüîí‚Äù at the beginning of a website: This means your connection is secure.
‚Ä¢ Check if the URL matches the BlaBlaCar website: A link in a message could look right, but if the URL doesn‚Äôt match the official website (https://www.blablacar.co.uk) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a scam. Always check the page's entire url before entering your login or payment info.
‚Ä¢ Use only your device: Don‚Äôt create accounts or enter passwords on a device that‚Äôs not yours ‚Äî like a friend‚Äôs phone or internet cafe.
‚Ä¢ Update your software and devices: These updates often address security risks and introduce new security protections.</p>

                    <h5>Off-site payments and messages</h5>
                    <p>Tips to keep you safe while exchanging messages with other members: ‚Ä¢ Only exchange on BlaBlaCar: Do not exchange on other platforms (WhatsApp, Messenger) before booking. ‚Ä¢ Keep your personal info secure: Never share your personal information like phone number, email and payment details before booking a ride. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt follow links in messages: Never click on or open a link in suspicious or unsolicited messages on the BlaBlaCar platform or third party messaging apps.</p>
