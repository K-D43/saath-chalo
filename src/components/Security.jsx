                    <h5>Password quality</h5>
                    <p>Your password should be at least 8 characters with a mix of at least 1 letter, 1 number, and 1 special character (e.g. #, @, &). Having complex and unique passwords on all your accounts, not just your BlaBlaCar account, will greatly reduce the chances of having security issues.</p>

                    <p>A few tips to help keep you safe online:
‚Ä¢ Check for ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù and ‚Äúüîí‚Äù at the beginning of a website: This means your connection is secure.
‚Ä¢ Check if the URL matches the BlaBlaCar website: A link in a message could look right, but if the URL doesn‚Äôt match the official website (https://www.blablacar.co.uk) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a scam. Always check the page's entire url before entering your login or payment info.
‚Ä¢ Use only your device: Don‚Äôt create accounts or enter passwords on a device that‚Äôs not yours ‚Äî like a friend‚Äôs phone or internet cafe.
‚Ä¢ Update your software and devices: These updates often address security risks and introduce new security protections.</p>

                    <h5>Off-site payments and messages</h5>
                    <p>Tips to keep you safe while exchanging messages with other members: ‚Ä¢ Only exchange on BlaBlaCar: Do not exchange on other platforms (WhatsApp, Messenger) before booking. ‚Ä¢ Keep your personal info secure: Never share your personal information like phone number, email and payment details before booking a ride. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt follow links in messages: Never click on or open a link in suspicious or unsolicited messages on the BlaBlaCar platform or third party messaging apps.</p>
